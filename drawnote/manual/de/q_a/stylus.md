What should I do if I can't draw with a stylus on the canvas?
---
If you are unable to draw with a stylus on the canvas, it may be due to the following reasons:

1. Ensure Stylus Mode is enabled - Click the "â‹®" button in the upper right corner to open the options menu and check if "Stylus Mode" is enabled.

2. Stylus connection issues - Make sure the stylus is correctly connected to the device. Try reconnection to ensure a stable connection.

3. Stylus battery issues - Check if the stylus has sufficient battery. Low battery levels may prevent the stylus from working properly.
