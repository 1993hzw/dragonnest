#### Tips
When recovering backup data, there are three strategies to choose from:

- Overwrite same notes - Replace the current notes with the backup content.
- Skip same notes - Keep the current notes unchanged when the backup content is the same.
- Auto merge - Merge the backup and existing notes based on the latest modification time.

Choose the appropriate strategy based on your needs and regularly back up to prevent data loss.
