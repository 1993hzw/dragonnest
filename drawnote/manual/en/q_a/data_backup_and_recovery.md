About Data Backup and Recovery
---
Our data backup method involves storing data in the private application directory of Google Drive, so users cannot directly view the backup content in Google Drive.

However, by checking the application data backups in Google Drive through the backup list in the Aspire Notes app, users can easily browse the backed-up application data.

Simply log in to different devices with the same Google account to effortlessly restore data between different devices.
