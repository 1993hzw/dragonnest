Difference Between Child Nodes and Sibling Nodes
---


In mind mapping, "child nodes" and "sibling nodes" are two commonly used concepts to represent different levels of relationships and connections:

- Child nodes - Content related to the current node at the next level, providing detailed information when expanded.

- Sibling nodes - Other nodes at the same level as the current node, sharing a similar hierarchy and importance.
