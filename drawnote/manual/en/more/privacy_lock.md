#### Tips
- Locked content cannot be searched directly.

- In the "My" and "Automatic Lock & Privacy Lock" interface, you can set Privacy Lock with fingerprint or password unlock.

- Privacy Lock is a local temporary locking mechanism. This means that when you lock notes, back them up, and then restore those notes on another device, you don't need to unlock them again to view their content.
