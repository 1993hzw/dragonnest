Eraser
---
The eraser feature offers multiple modes for various use cases.
#### Steps

Click the "Eraser" button in the toolbar.

- Normal Mode - Utilizes mask technology to realistically simulate the eraser effect. Can erase various elements such as lines, text, and images. This mode creates erasure marks, allowing users to select erased elements.


- Fill Mode - Similar to the normal mode but can quickly erase a fan-shaped area.


- Cutting Mode - Splits elements into multiple independent parts, only applicable to lines and some geometric shapes. This mode leaves no trace after erasing.


- Selection Mode - Directly deletes the selected entire element and supports setting filter criteria. This mode leaves no trace after erasing.
