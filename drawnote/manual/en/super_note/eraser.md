Eraser
---

The eraser function offers multiple modes for various use cases.

#### Operating Steps

Click the "Eraser" button in the toolbar.

- Normal Mode - Uses masking technology to simulate the eraser effect realistically. It can erase various elements such as lines, text, and images. This mode generates erasure marks, allowing users to select the erased elements.

- Fill Mode - Similar to normal mode but can quickly erase a sector area.

- Cut Mode - Cuts elements into multiple independent parts, suitable for erasing lines and some geometric shapes. This mode leaves no trace after erasure.

- Select Mode - Directly deletes the selected entire elements and supports setting filtering conditions. This mode leaves no trace after erasure.
