**Disclaimer**

Welcome to DrawNote (hereinafter referred to as the "Application"). Before you start using the application, please read the following disclaimer carefully. By downloading, installing, accessing, or using this application, you indicate that you have read, understood, and agreed to accept the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use this application.

1. **Data Security and Privacy**

The application provides a local data lock feature, but please note that this feature only applies to data on your local device. With data lock enabled, data will be encrypted and protected on your local device. However, when performing data backup, cloud synchronization, or export operations, the lock status will not be synchronized. This means that when you lock notes, back them up, and then restore these notes on other devices, you will not need to unlock them again to view their content. Therefore, before performing these operations, please ensure the security of your data and fully understand the associated risks to prevent data loss or leakage.

2. **Data Backup and Synchronization**

The application provides data backup and synchronization functionality, but please note that these features may involve integration with third-party services or platforms. While we will make efforts to implement appropriate security measures to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security or privacy protection measures of third-party services. You should understand and confirm any privacy policies and terms associated with third-party services on your own.
